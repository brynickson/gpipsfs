gpipsfs: GPI Point Spread Function (PSF) Simulation Toolkit
================================================================

This Python package produces simulated PSFs for the Gemini Planet
Imager, a facility-class exoplanets imaging instrument at Gemini
South.

Installation (the really simple way)
----------------------------------------

Download the zip file and unzip. And then::

    > cd to that folder

    > python setup.py install


Getting Started
------------------

Check out the ipython notebooks, in particular the 'Getting Started" one. 

Depending on which version of IPython (now a.k.a. Jupyter) you have installed, 
you make have trouble opening some of the notebooks. If you run into this problem, 
either: 

1. Install a recent version of IPython, 3.0 or greater. (The latest version of 
   the Anaconda scientific python distribution includes this, for instance.). Or else
2. Try the filenames with the "v3" in them, which are in "notebook format 3". 
   (Confusingly, ipython 3 uses notebook format 4, while ipython 2 uses file format 3!) 
   If that still doesn't work for you, ask Marshall for help.
